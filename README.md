## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We aim to see how analysts **analyze soccer teams based on different factors that contribute to the game**. Soccer is a tricky sport to model because there are so few goals scored in each match. The final scoreline will fairly often disagree with many people’s impressions of the quality of each team’s play, and the low-scoring nature of the sport will sometimes lead to prolonged periods of luck, where a team may be getting good results despite playing poorly (or vice versa). Therefore, the analysis, which is updated monthly provides information, on how team's overall performance affect their overall ranking estimating each team's underlying quality of performance. Factoring in things like league strength also, the data provides insight into learning about future scores, as the SPI (Soccer Power Index) is used by oddsmakers to figure out betting odds also.



## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset aims to calculate world club ranking for men's soccer/football. It calcutates using this index called the SPI ratings that describes how every team has an offensive rating that represents the number of goals it would be expected to score against an average team on a neutral field, and a defensive rating that represents the number of goals it would be expected to concede. The dataset comes about, as a team’s SPI ratings are based on two factors: its ratings at the end of the previous season, and its market value as calculated by Transfermarket, a site that assigns a monetary value to each player, based on what they would fetch in a transfer. The dataset includes team's from all continents and they're most competitve leagues, for example Philadelphia Union a team in the MLS has a previous rank of 230 however, the updated ranks show they've improved to 228. The data collection company fivethirtyeight collected this dataset as, it aims to predict the new 2020/21 football season. The purpose of this dataset is more for light hearted informative purposes on the global sporting world. The data is collected through their forecasting algorithims and what was just described.

2. Manchester City
